TEAL's innovation design - incorporating advanced AI technology and remote monitoring - far outperforms traditional central plants, resulting in a significantly reduced carbon footprint and the lowest total lifecycle cost. The future of central plants and your next opportunity are available today! POSITION OVERVIEW: Teal is seeking a professional, skilled Python Software Developer for our Controls team. The successful candidate will work with the Teal software development team to develop and sustain technologies for HVAC commercial products. Teal operates an IOT network, which manages the operation and optimization of a distributed infrastructure system. Each node in the network uses a Teal control module to acquire data and transmit control logic to the underlying hardware. The sites utilize common HVAC hardware including air handlers, fan coils, chillers, heat pumps, and boilers.
